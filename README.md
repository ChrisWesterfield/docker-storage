## About

This is a data container and is meant to do nothing but act as the shared storage point for all the other containers in the cluster.

## Usage

To build this as a Docker image, clone the repository and from within the project directory run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Credit

Thanks to [Tianon Gravi](https://github.com/tianon/) for the REAL work.
